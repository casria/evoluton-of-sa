01. The data in *.fq.gz format was aligned with the Nipponbare genome (https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html) and the output files were gvcf and vcf.
02. Five key SNPs were extracted from gvcf, corresponding to chromosome 1: 22376434/22381235/22386181/22386182/22386315 position in the Nipponbare genome. Calculate sequence depth of the Sa complex locus chromosome 1:22375575 - 22386532.
03. Calculate the missing information via the depth file.
04. Calculate the nucleotide diversity and fixation index via VCFtools.
05. Visualize the generated data in R.
06. Syntenic analysis.
